ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @myselfalameen
ðŸ‘€ I am currently immersed in learning data analytics and system simulation, driven by a passion to contribute to data-driven decision-making.
ðŸŽ¯ I am actively seeking collaborative projects in machine learning and different kinds of system behaviour. Simultaneously, I am cultivating skills to transition into a role as a data analyst, aiming to handle diverse projects within the supply chain domain.
âš½ My interest extends to exploring the dynamic intersection of data analytics in sports team management, with a focus on acquiring and leveraging data to enhance team performance and strategic decision-making.
